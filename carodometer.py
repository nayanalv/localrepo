#using starting and ending value of the odometer, calculate its milage.?
#2)measure the fuel consumed
#3)calculate the numbers of stops one should make for refuelling while travelling from bangalore to goa, 
# a distance of 560km
# Mileage=Distance Traveled​/fuel consumed


#lets assume starting as 50,000km and ending as 51,500km and assume fuel consumed as 40
#assume car fuel tank capacity as 40ltr


#distance travelled = ending of odometer-starting of odometer
distance_travelled = 51500 - 50000 # i.e 1500km
# Mileage=Distance Traveled​/fuel consumed
Mileage = 1500/50  i.e 30km/ltr

#fuel_consumed= initial fuel - remaining fuel
fuel_consumed= 50 - 40 #i.e 10

#Number of Stops=Distance Covered Per Tank/Total Distance

#Where: one time full tank->Distance Covered Per Tank = Fuel Tank Capacity * Mileage
d=40*30 i.e = 1200 km

#bangalore to Goa distance is 560km
#Since the distance between Bangalore and Goa is 660 km, which is less than the distance you can cover on one full tank (1,200 km),
# you wouldn’t need any refueling stops.

#Example Scenario (if you had a smaller fuel tank or lower mileage):

Fuel Tank Capacity: 20 liters
Mileage: 15 km/l
Then: 
Distance Covered Per Tank= 20liters*15km/l= 300km

Number of Stops=660km/300km

Number of Stops=2.2
 
In this case, you would need 2 stops for refueling during the trip from Bangalore to Goa.
